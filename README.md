## Why?

A couple years back, me and my friend read [the following](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/11408672/North-Korea-releases-barrage-of-propaganda-slogans.html) article
about North Korean Goverment releasing a bunch of weird propaganda slogans. After some poking around the internet, we managed to
find a text file containg them. So we came up with an idea of using them as an input for automatic text
generator that would generate new slogans based on existing ones.

## How?

Slogans are generated by [Markov Chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) fed with data from `data/training-data.txt` file and
then persisted to a database.

Generation and persistance processes are independent and communicate with each other
through [RabbitMQ queue](https://www.rabbitmq.com/). Main process is spawning workers using
[cluster](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) to run parallel generation and persistance.

The Web application is an [Express](http://expressjs.com/) app that reads
existing slogans from the database and displayes them with a soup of social-media
tags for nicer sharing.

## Where

Currently, the application is hosted as a free-tier Heroku app with Postgres and RabbitMQ
plugins. Generation worker is disabled so it does not consume resources while idling. Database
contains around **10 000** pre-generated quotes.
